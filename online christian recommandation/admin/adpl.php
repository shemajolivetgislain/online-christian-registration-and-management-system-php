<text>I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else
    The Christian does not think God will love us because we are good, but that God will make us good because He loves us
    To be a Christian means to forgive the inexcusable because God has forgiven the inexcusable in you.
    I didn’t go to religion to make me happy. I always knew a bottle of Port would do that. If you want a religion to make you feel really comfortable, I certainly don’t recommend Christianity.
    [To have Faith in Christ] means, of course, trying to do all that He says. There would be no sense in saying you trusted a person if you would not take his advice. Thus if you have really handed yourself over to Him, it must follow that you are trying to obey Him. But trying in a new way, a less worried way. Not doing these things in order to be saved, but because He has begun to save you already. Not hoping to get to Heaven as a reward for your actions, but inevitably wanting to act in a certain way because a first faint gleam of Heaven is already inside you.”
